- Provides clear instructions if no server is available
- Executable and ready to use

### 5. Test Results Template
**File:** `TEST_RESULTS_TEMPLATE.md`

A comprehensive template for documenting manual test results:
- Test session information
- Summary checklist
- Detailed results for all 10 test categories
- Performance observations
- Issues tracking (critical, major, minor)
- Browser-specific issues section
- Recommendations section
- Sign-off area

### 6. Quick Reference Card
**File:** `TESTING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

A concise reference guide with:
- Quick start commands
- Manual auth simulation
- Quick timer tests
- LocalStorage inspection
- Responsive testing shortcuts
- Debugging commands
