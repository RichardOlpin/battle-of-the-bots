# AuraFlow Notification Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test the notification permission handling and fallback mechanisms in the AuraFlow web application.

## Overview

The AuraFlow web app implements a robust notification system that:
- Requests notification permission on app initialization
- Handles all permission states (granted, denied, default, unsupported)
- Shows in-app fallback notifications when browser notifications are unavailable
- Stores permission state for future reference
- Provides visual feedback to users about notification status

## Testing Setup

### Prerequisites
1. A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
2. A local web server to serve the webapp files
3. Access to browser developer tools

### Starting the Test Server

```bash
# Option 1: Using Python
cd webapp
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Using Node.js http-server
npx http-server webapp -p 8000

# Option 3: Using PHP
cd webapp
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open: `http://localhost:8000`

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Test Initial Permission Request

**Objective:** Verify that the app requests notification permission on first load.

**Steps:**
1. Clear browser data (cookies, localStorage, site permissions)
2. Open the web app in a fresh browser session
3. Observe the browser's permission prompt

**Expected Results:**
- Browser shows a permission prompt asking to allow notifications
- If granted: Console logs "Notification permission granted"
- If denied: Console logs "Notification permission denied" and shows status message
- Permission state is saved to localStorage

**Verification:**
```javascript
// Check in browser console
localStorage.getItem('notificationPermission')
// Should return: "granted", "denied", or "default"
```

### 2. Test Granted Permission State

**Objective:** Verify browser notifications work when permission is granted.

**Steps:**
1. Open the web app
2. Grant notification permission when prompted
3. Start a focus session
4. Wait for session to complete (or use test page)

**Expected Results:**
- Browser notification appears with title and message
- Notification shows AuraFlow icon
- Notification auto-dismisses after a few seconds
- Console logs show successful notification creation

**Test Using Test Page:**
```
Open: http://localhost:8000/test-notifications.html
Click: "Request Permission" â†’ Grant
Click: "Test Browser Notification"
```

---

### 3. Test Denied Permission State

**Objective:** Verify in-app fallback notifications work when permission is denied.

**Steps:**
1. Open the web app
2. Deny notification permission when prompted (or block in browser settings)
3. Observe the status message
4. Start a focus session and complete it

**Expected Results:**
- Status message appears: "Browser notifications disabled. You'll see in-app alerts instead."
- When session completes, an in-app notification slides in from the right
- In-app notification shows:
  - Bell icon (ðŸ””)
  - Title and message
  - Close button (Ã—)
  - Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- Notification is styled according to current theme

**Test Using Test Page:**
```
Open: http://localhost:8000/test-notifications.html
Click: "Request Permission" â†’ Deny
Click: "Test In-App Notification"
```

---

### 4. Test Default Permission State

**Objective:** Verify behavior when user hasn't responded to permission prompt.

**Steps:**
1. Open the web app
2. Dismiss/ignore the permission prompt (don't click Allow or Block)
3. Try to trigger a notification

**Expected Results:**
- Permission remains in "default" state
- In-app fallback notification is shown
- No error messages in console

---

### 5. Test Unsupported Browser

**Objective:** Verify graceful degradation in browsers without notification support.

**Steps:**
1. Test in an older browser or disable notifications via browser flags
2. Open the web app

**Expected Results:**
- No permission prompt appears
- Console logs: "Notifications not supported in this browser"
- In-app notifications work as fallback
- Permission state saved as "unsupported"

---

### 6. Test In-App Notification Features

**Objective:** Verify all in-app notification functionality.

**Steps:**
1. Deny notification permission
2. Trigger multiple notifications
3. Test close button
4. Test auto-dismiss
5. Test on mobile viewport

**Expected Results:**
- Notifications slide in from right with smooth animation
- Multiple notifications stack vertically
- Close button (Ã—) works immediately
- Notifications auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Notifications are responsive on mobile (full width)
- Proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

**Test Using Test Page:**
```
Open: http://localhost:8000/test-notifications.html
Click: "Test In-App Notification" multiple times
```

---

### 7. Test Permission State Persistence

**Objective:** Verify permission state is remembered across sessions.

**Steps:**
1. Grant or deny permission
2. Close the browser tab
3. Reopen the web app
4. Check if permission is remembered

**Expected Results:**
- No permission prompt on subsequent visits
- Stored permission state is used
- Appropriate notification method is used (browser or in-app)

**Verification:**
```javascript
// Check in browser console
localStorage.getItem('notificationPermission')
```

---

### 8. Test Session Complete Notification

**Objective:** Verify notifications work in real session flow.

**Steps:**
1. Start a focus session (Quick Focus or custom)
2. Wait for session to complete (or modify timer for faster testing)
3. Observe notification

**Expected Results:**
- Notification appears with "Session Complete!" title
- Message: "Great work! Time for a break."
- Uses appropriate method based on permission state
- Notification is timely (appears immediately on completion)

---

### 9. Test Theme Compatibility

**Objective:** Verify in-app notifications work with all themes.

**Steps:**
1. Deny notification permission
2. Switch between themes (Light, Dark, Calm, Beach, Rain)
3. Trigger in-app notification in each theme

**Expected Results:**
- Notifications are visible in all themes
- Colors adapt to theme (background, text, borders)
- Animations work smoothly
- No visual glitches

---

### 10. Test Mobile Responsiveness

**Objective:** Verify notifications work on mobile devices.

**Steps:**
1. Open web app on mobile device or use browser dev tools mobile emulation
2. Test both browser and in-app notifications
3. Test in portrait and landscape orientations

**Expected Results:**
- In-app notifications are full-width on mobile
- Notifications don't overflow screen
- Touch targets are large enough (close button)
- Animations are smooth on mobile
- Status message appears at bottom on mobile

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: Permission prompt doesn't appear
**Solution:**
- Check if permission was previously denied
