# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Slack integration to the AuraFlow Chrome extension, allowing users to control their Slack status directly from the extension UI. Users will be able to toggle between different status modes (Available, Focused, Do Not Disturb) with a single click, helping them manage their availability and minimize interruptions during focus sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Slack Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate my Slack workspace with the extension, so that the extension can update my status on my behalf.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a "Connect Slack" button THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth authentication flow with Slack
2. WHEN the OAuth flow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL store the access token securely in Chrome storage
3. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display the connected workspace name in the UI
4. IF the authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user
5. WHEN the user wants to disconnect THEN the system SHALL provide a way to revoke the connection and clear stored credentials

### Requirement 2: Status Toggle UI

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see status toggle buttons in the extension popup, so that I can quickly change my Slack status without leaving my current context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension popup AND is authenticated with Slack THEN the system SHALL display status toggle buttons for Available, Focused, and Do Not Disturb
2. WHEN the user is not authenticated with Slack THEN the system SHALL display a "Connect Slack" button instead of status toggles
3. WHEN displaying status buttons THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the current active status
4. WHEN the user hovers over a status button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
5. WHEN the extension popup is opened THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the current Slack status within 2 seconds

### Requirement 3: Status Update Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click a status button to update my Slack status, so that my team knows my availability without manual updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Available" button THEN the system SHALL update the Slack status to available with a green status emoji and clear any custom status text
2. WHEN the user clicks the "Focused" button THEN the system SHALL update the Slack status to active with a "ðŸŽ¯" emoji and status text "In focus mode"
3. WHEN the user clicks the "Do Not Disturb" button THEN the system SHALL enable Slack DND mode and set status to "ðŸ”•" emoji with text "Do not disturb"
4. WHEN a status update is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator on the clicked button
5. WHEN a status update succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the new active status
6. IF a status update fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and keep the previous status active in the UI
7. WHEN the user clicks the currently active status button THEN the system SHALL take no action

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Token Refresh

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to handle authentication errors gracefully, so that I'm informed when re-authentication is needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Slack API returns an "invalid_auth" error THEN the system SHALL clear the stored token and prompt the user to reconnect
2. WHEN the Slack API returns a rate limit error THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the user should try again later
3. WHEN a network error occurs during status update THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
4. WHEN the access token expires THEN the system SHALL detect this and prompt for re-authentication
5. IF the Slack API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5: Status Persistence and Sync

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to remember my last selected status, so that I can see what status I set even after closing the popup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sets a status THEN the system SHALL store the selected status locally in Chrome storage
2. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display the last known status immediately while fetching the current status from Slack
3. WHEN the current Slack status differs from the last known status THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the actual Slack status
4. WHEN the user changes their status outside the extension THEN the system SHALL reflect this change when the popup is next opened
