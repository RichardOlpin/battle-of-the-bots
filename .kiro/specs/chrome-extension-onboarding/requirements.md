# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AuraFlow Chrome Extension is a simple productivity tool for remote professionals that connects to Google Calendar and displays today's events. This extension serves as the foundation for helping users see their daily schedule at a glance within their browser environment. The focus is on creating a clean, functional extension that authenticates with Google Calendar and presents today's events in an easy-to-read format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a remote professional, I want to install a Chrome extension that connects to my Google Calendar, so that I can quickly view my daily schedule without switching tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user installs the Chrome extension THEN the system SHALL display an extension icon in the Chrome toolbar
2. WHEN the user clicks the extension icon for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a popup with a "Connect Google Calendar" button
3. WHEN the user clicks "Connect Google Calendar" THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with Google Calendar API
4. WHEN the user completes Google Calendar authentication THEN the system SHALL store the access token securely in Chrome storage
5. IF Google Calendar authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a remote professional, I want to see today's calendar events in the extension popup, so that I can quickly check my schedule without opening Google Calendar.

2. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL show event title, start time, and end time for each event

5. WHEN events are displayed THEN the system SHALL show them in chronological order from earliest to latest

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a remote professional, I want the extension to remember my authentication, so that I don't have to reconnect to Google Calendar every time I use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL store authentication tokens in Chrome's secure storage
2. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL check for valid stored authentication
3. WHEN stored authentication is valid THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch and display today's events
4. WHEN stored authentication is expired THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to reconnect
5. WHEN the user wants to disconnect THEN the system SHALL provide a logout option that clears stored tokens
