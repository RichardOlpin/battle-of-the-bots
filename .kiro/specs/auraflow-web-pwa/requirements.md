# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves porting the existing AuraFlow Chrome Extension into a standalone web application with Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities. The goal is to make AuraFlow accessible across multiple platforms - desktop browsers, mobile browsers, and as an installable mobile app - while maintaining all core functionality. The approach focuses on refactoring the existing Chrome extension code to separate platform-agnostic logic from Chrome-specific APIs, then building a new web-based shell that reuses this core logic and adds PWA features for offline functionality and mobile installation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Logic Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application logic separated from platform-specific code, so that the same core functionality can be reused across different platforms (Chrome extension, web app, PWA).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all timer countdown logic SHALL be isolated in a platform-agnostic module
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all work/break state management logic SHALL be isolated in a platform-agnostic module
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all backend API data preparation functions SHALL be isolated in a platform-agnostic module
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the core logic module SHALL export all functions for reuse
5. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the core logic module SHALL NOT contain any Chrome-specific API calls

### Requirement 2: Platform Abstraction Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a platform abstraction layer for Chrome-specific APIs, so that the extension code can be easily adapted to use different platform services without major rewrites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the abstraction layer is implemented THEN it SHALL provide wrapper functions for Chrome storage operations
2. WHEN the abstraction layer is implemented THEN it SHALL provide wrapper functions for Chrome notification operations
3. WHEN the extension code is refactored THEN all direct Chrome API calls SHALL be replaced with abstraction layer function calls
4. WHEN the abstraction layer functions are called THEN they SHALL maintain the same behavior as the original Chrome API calls
5. WHEN new platform implementations are needed THEN developers SHALL be able to implement the same function signatures using different underlying APIs

### Requirement 3: Standalone Web Application

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access AuraFlow through a standard web browser without installing a Chrome extension, so that I can use the app on any device with a modern browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web app is accessed THEN it SHALL display the same user interface as the Chrome extension
2. WHEN the web app is accessed THEN it SHALL provide all core timer functionality (start, pause, reset)
3. WHEN the web app is accessed THEN it SHALL support work and break session modes
4. WHEN the web app is used THEN it SHALL persist user data using browser localStorage
5. WHEN the web app is used THEN it SHALL send session data to the backend API
6. WHEN the web app is viewed on different screen sizes THEN it SHALL display a responsive layout
7. WHEN the web app needs to show notifications THEN it SHALL use the Web Notifications API

### Requirement 4: Progressive Web App Features

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to install AuraFlow on my phone's home screen and use it offline, so that I can access my focus timer without an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the web app on a mobile device THEN the browser SHALL offer an "Add to Home Screen" option
2. WHEN the app is installed THEN it SHALL appear with the AuraFlow icon on the device home screen
3. WHEN the installed app is launched THEN it SHALL open in standalone mode without browser UI
4. WHEN the app is accessed offline THEN the main user interface SHALL load from cache
5. WHEN the app is accessed offline THEN core timer functionality SHALL remain operational
6. WHEN the app manifest is loaded THEN it SHALL define appropriate app name, colors, and icons
7. WHEN the service worker is registered THEN it SHALL cache essential app shell files on installation
8. WHEN the service worker handles fetch requests THEN it SHALL serve cached resources before attempting network requests

### Requirement 5: Asset Reuse and Code Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maximize code reuse from the existing Chrome extension, so that development time is minimized and consistency is maintained across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web app is built THEN it SHALL reuse the HTML structure from the Chrome extension popup
2. WHEN the web app is built THEN it SHALL reuse the CSS styles from the Chrome extension
3. WHEN the web app is built THEN it SHALL reuse the core logic module created during refactoring
4. WHEN the web app is built THEN it SHALL reuse icon assets from the Chrome extension
5. WHEN the web app is built THEN it SHALL be organized in a separate top-level directory named `webapp/`
6. WHEN the web app is built THEN it SHALL NOT modify the existing Chrome extension code structure

### Requirement 6: Testing and Verification

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want clear testing instructions for the web app and PWA features, so that I can verify all functionality works correctly across different platforms and network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing documentation is created THEN it SHALL include instructions for running the web app locally
2. WHEN testing documentation is created THEN it SHALL include steps to verify desktop browser functionality
3. WHEN testing documentation is created THEN it SHALL include steps to verify responsive design
4. WHEN testing documentation is created THEN it SHALL include steps to install the PWA on a mobile device
5. WHEN testing documentation is created THEN it SHALL include steps to verify offline functionality
6. WHEN offline functionality is tested THEN the tester SHALL be able to confirm the app loads without network connectivity
