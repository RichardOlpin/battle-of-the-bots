# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the AI features and service integrations for AuraFlow, a Mindful Flow Assistant application. The scope is limited to backend AI logic and API integrations that will power the intelligent features of the application during a 2-day hackathon. The implementation will use rule-based simulations and clever algorithms rather than actual machine learning models, focusing on proving the concept with smart, deterministic behavior.

The AI features will be exposed as RESTful API endpoints that can serve multiple clients (web application and Chrome extension). All work will be committed to the battle-of-the-bots repository under the ks7585 GitHub user.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment and Repository Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly configure my Git environment and clone the project repository, so that all my work is correctly attributed and committed to the right location.

5. WHEN making commits THEN all commits SHALL be attributed to the configured user identity

### Requirement 2: Smart Scheduling Assistant

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function suggestOptimalFocusWindow is called with calendar events and user preferences THEN the system SHALL identify all time slots longer than 75 minutes
2. WHEN evaluating time slots THEN the system SHALL implement a scoring system that prioritizes slots based on user preferences
3. IF the user preference is 'morning' THEN the system SHALL give higher scores to slots between 8 AM and 12 PM
4. WHEN identifying available slots THEN the system SHALL enforce a mandatory buffer of at least 15 minutes before and after any existing calendar event
5. WHEN scoring time slots THEN the system SHALL deprioritize or exclude slots after 9 PM
6. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL return a single optimal time block with startTime and endTime in ISO 8601 format
7. WHEN no suitable slots are found THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error or empty result

### Requirement 3: Personalized Ritual Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to suggest focus ritual structures based on my current context, so that I can use the most appropriate work pattern for my situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function generatePersonalizedRitual is called with context THEN the system SHALL accept calendarEventTitle, timeOfDay, and calendarDensity as input parameters
2. WHEN the calendarEventTitle contains "planning", "review", or "emails" THEN the system SHALL suggest a short-burst ritual with 25 minutes work and 5 minutes break

4. IF calendarDensity is 'busy' AND timeOfDay is 'afternoon' THEN the system SHALL suggest a recovery ritual with longer breaks
5. WHEN the ritual is generated THEN the system SHALL return an object containing name, workDuration, breakDuration, and mindfulnessBreaks properties
6. WHEN parsing the calendar event title THEN the system SHALL use case-insensitive keyword matching
7. WHEN no keywords match THEN the system SHALL return a default balanced ritual

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Session Summaries

6. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL avoid negative language or judgment about productivity

### Requirement 5: Google Calendar Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely connect my Google Calendar, so that the system can analyze my schedule and suggest optimal focus times.

2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL securely store access tokens and refresh tokens
3. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for API keys and client secrets
4. WHEN credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve user tokens securely from storage
5. WHEN fetching calendar events THEN the system SHALL accept a date range as parameters
6. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN the system SHALL return calendar events in a normalized format
7. WHEN the access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it using the refresh token
8. WHEN API keys or secrets are used THEN they SHALL never be hardcoded in the source code

### Requirement 6: Task Management Integration Stubs

**User Story:** As a developer, I want placeholder functions for task management integrations, so that the architecture supports future expansion to Notion, Todoist, and Asana.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating integration functions THEN the system SHALL create placeholder functions for Notion, Todoist, and Asana
2. WHEN the function fetchTasksFromNotion is called THEN it SHALL accept an apiToken parameter
3. WHEN the function fetchTasksFromTodoist is called THEN it SHALL accept an apiToken parameter
4. WHEN the function fetchTasksFromAsana is called THEN it SHALL accept an apiToken parameter
5. WHEN any stub function is called THEN it SHALL return hardcoded mock data in the expected format
6. WHEN stub functions are implemented THEN they SHALL have the correct function signature for future implementation
7. WHEN mock data is returned THEN it SHALL be realistic and useful for testing client applications

### Requirement 7: RESTful API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want well-defined RESTful API endpoints, so that I can integrate the AI features into the web application and Chrome extension.
