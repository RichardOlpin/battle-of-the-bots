# Security Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Slack OAuth Credentials (CWE-547)
**Severity:** High (Score: 805)
**Location:** `auraflow-extension/background.js` lines 369-373

**Problem:**
- Slack Client ID and Client Secret were hardcoded directly in the source code
- These credentials were committed to version control
- Anyone with access to the repository could use these credentials

**Solution:**
- Moved credentials to external `config.js` file (not tracked in git)
- Added `config.example.js` as a template for setup
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `config.js` and other config files
- Modified `SlackAuthUtils` to load credentials dynamically from config
- Added validation to check if credentials are properly configured
- Created `SETUP.md` with detailed setup instructions

**Files Changed:**
- `auraflow-extension/background.js` - Removed hardcoded secrets, added config loading
- `auraflow-extension/config.example.js` - Created template config file
- `auraflow-extension/SETUP.md` - Created setup documentation
- `auraflow-extension/manifest.json` - Added config.js to web_accessible_resources
- `.gitignore` - Added config.js exclusion

### 2. DOM-based XSS Vulnerabilities (CWE-79)
**Severity:** High (Score: 814)
**Location:** `webapp/diagnostic.html` multiple locations

**Problem:**
- Multiple instances of `innerHTML` being used with unsanitized user input
- Data from `window.location`, `error.message`, API responses, and other external sources
- Could allow XSS attacks through crafted URLs or error messages

**Solution:**
- Replaced all unsafe `innerHTML` assignments with safe DOM methods:
  - `textContent` for text-only content
  - `createTextNode()` for dynamic text
  - `createElement()` for structured content
- Applied fixes to all functions:
  - `checkEnvironment()` - Fixed URL display
  - `checkServiceWorker()` - Fixed service worker scope display
  - `checkCache()` - Fixed cache name display
  - `testFiles()` - Fixed file path and content type display
  - `testBackend()` - Fixed API response display
  - Error handlers - Fixed error message display
  - Console error capture - Fixed error event display

**Files Changed:**
- `webapp/diagnostic.html` - Fixed all XSS vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Secrets Management:**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use configuration files excluded from git
   - Provide example/template files for setup
   - Document setup process clearly

2. **XSS Prevention:**
   - Always sanitize user input before rendering
   - Use `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` for untrusted data
   - Create DOM elements programmatically when possible
   - Validate and escape all external data sources

3. **Defense in Depth:**
   - Multiple layers of validation
   - Clear error messages for misconfiguration
   - Documentation for secure setup

## Next Steps

1. **For Slack Integration:**
   - Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
   - Add your actual Slack app credentials
   - Follow the setup guide in `SETUP.md`
   - Reload the extension

2. **For Existing Deployments:**
   - Rotate the exposed Slack credentials immediately
   - Create new Slack app credentials
   - Update all deployments with new credentials
   - Review access logs for unauthorized usage

3. **For Future Development:**
   - Never hardcode secrets in source code
   - Use environment variables or secure config files
   - Always sanitize user input before rendering
   - Run security scanning tools regularly
