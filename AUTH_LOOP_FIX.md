# Auth Loop Fix

## Problem

After successful authentication, the app kept redirecting to auth over and over in an infinite loop:

```
1. User authenticates with Google ✅
2. Backend redirects to webapp ✅
3. Webapp loads
4. Webapp checks auth → No token found ❌
5. Webapp redirects to auth again ❌
6. Loop continues... ❌
```

## Root Cause

The webapp was checking for `authToken` in storage, but the backend never sent it back. The backend stores tokens server-side, but the webapp had no way to know the user was authenticated.

## Solution

### 1. Backend Stores User ID in localStorage

When auth succeeds, the backend now stores the user ID:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('auraflow_user_id', '${userId}');
```

### 2. Webapp Saves Auth Token After Redirect

When the webapp detects successful auth, it saves a token:

```javascript
Platform.saveData('authToken', {
    token: 'backend_session',
    userId: userId,
    timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

### 3. Webapp Checks Backend for Auth Status

If no local token, the webapp now checks with the backend:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${BACKEND_API_URL}/auth/status`);
```

## Test It Now!

### Step 1: Clear Browser Storage

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
localStorage.clear();
```

### Step 2: Restart Servers

```bash
./restart-all.sh
```

### Step 3: Test Authentication

1. Open: `http://localhost:5000`
2. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
3. Sign in with Google
4. **Should redirect once and stay on events page!** ✅

---

## What Should Happen

### Correct Flow (No Loop)

```
1. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
   ↓
2. Redirect to Google
   ↓
3. Sign in and grant permissions
   ↓
4. Redirect to backend callback
   ↓
5. Backend stores tokens server-side
   ↓
6. Backend shows success page
   ↓
7. Success page stores userId in localStorage
   ↓
8. Redirect to webapp after 2 seconds
   ↓
9. Webapp detects auth success
   ↓
10. Webapp saves authToken
   ↓
11. Webapp loads events
   ↓
12. ✅ DONE - No more redirects!
```

## Files Modified

1. **battle-of-the-bots/src/routes/auth.routes.js**
   - Added: `localStorage.setItem('auraflow_user_id', userId)`

2. **webapp/app.js**
   - Updated: `checkAuth()` - Now checks backend if no local token
   - Updated: `checkAuthSuccess()` - Saves authToken after successful auth

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Auth Loop?

**Step 1: Clear everything**
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
```

**Step 2: Hard refresh**
```
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

**Step 3: Check console**
```
Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
Look for: "Detected successful authentication"
```

### Auth Succeeds But No Events Load

**Check backend logs:**
```
Should see: GET /api/auth/google/callback
Should NOT see repeated: GET /api/auth/google
```

**Check browser console:**
```
Should see: "User is authenticated"
Should NOT see: "User is not authenticated" repeatedly
```

---

## Verification

### Success Indicators

**✅ Working correctly when:**
1. Auth redirects only ONCE
2. After redirect, stays on events page
3. Console shows: "Detected successful authentication"
4. Console shows: "User is authenticated"
5. Events load automatically
6. No more auth redirects

**❌ Still broken if:**
1. Keeps redirecting to Google
2. Console shows: "User is not authenticated" repeatedly
3. Never loads events
4. Stuck in loop

---

## Quick Test

```bash
# 1. Clear browser storage
# Open console (F12) and run:
localStorage.clear();

# 2. Restart servers
./restart-all.sh

# 3. Test
# Open: http://localhost:5000
# Click "Connect Google Calendar"
# Should work without loop! ✅
```

---

## Summary

**Before:**
- ❌ Auth loop - kept redirecting
- ❌ Never loaded events
- ❌ Webapp didn't know user was authenticated

**After:**
- ✅ Auth works once
- ✅ Stays on events page
- ✅ Events load automatically
- ✅ No more loops!

---

**Status:** ✅ Fixed!  
**Test:** Clear localStorage, restart servers, try auth
